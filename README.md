# Quantum

Quantum is a random location generator for 1.16+. It provides an exhaustive API to allow plugins and users to define their own custom location generation algorithms.

As Quantum is intended to be used as an API, there are no user-facing features implemented. Instead of bundlng the logic for the various first-party modules, Quantum is split up into Quantum (the API), QuantumWild and QuantumSpawn. Here's some more information about these modules.

## QuantumWild

QuantumWild is a /wild plugin utilizing the Quantum API. QuantumWild is still in development, but you can read more [here](#).

## QuantumSpawn

QuantumSpawn is a random spawn plugin utilizing the Quantum API. QuantumSpawn is still in development, but you can read more [here](#).

## Features

_NOTE: Read the wiki for an introduction to Quantum, it's features, and the API._

Quantum has two main features: RTP, and /wild. Here's a break down of Quantum's main selling points.
